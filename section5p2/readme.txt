Y. Kanno: ``On three concepts in robust design optimization: absolute robustness, relative robustness, and less variance.'' Submitted to {\em Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization\/}.

The codes can run on Matlab ver.9.6 with Optimization Toolbox, SeDuMi ver.1.3, and CVX ver.2.1. In this environment, run "pareto_worst.m", "pareto_discrepancy.m", and "pareto_variance.m" for solving the optimization problems dealt with in section 5.2 of the article.
